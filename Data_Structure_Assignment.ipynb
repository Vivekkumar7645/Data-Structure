        "* Value: The data associated with the key (can be of any type).\n",
        "2. Hashing\n",
        "* Hash Function: When a key is added to a dictionary, Python calculates a hash value for the key using a built-in hash function (hash()).\n",
        "This hash value determines where in the hash table the key-value pair will be stored.\n",
        "3. Buckets\n",

        "4. Collision Handling\n",
        "* Collisions occur when two keys produce the same hash value.\n",
        "* Python handles collisions using open addressing or chaining mechanisms internally.\n",
        "* For open addressing, Python may probe for the next available bucket.\n",
        "* For chaining, it links multiple values in the same bucket (though Python typically avoids direct chaining).\n",

        "* Average Case: Dictionary operations (e.g., insert, delete, retrieve) have an average time complexity of ùëÇ(1), assuming minimal collisions.\n",

        "6. Resizing When a dictionary becomes too full (load factor exceeds a threshold), Python resizes the hash table.\n",

        "**Ans** -Dictionaries in Python offer several advantages over lists for certain tasks, particularly when working with key-value pairs and needing efficient lookups. Here's a breakdown of why you might choose dictionaries over lists in specific scenarios:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Fast Lookups (O(1) Average Time Complexity)\n",
        "* Dictionaries: Provide constant-time average performance for lookups by key, thanks to their hash table implementation.\n",
        "* Lists: Require linear search (ùëÇ(ùëõ)) to find an item, as elements must be traversed sequentially.\n",
        "2. Key-Value Pair Storage\n",
        "* Dictionaries: Designed for storing and managing data as key-value pairs. Each key uniquely identifies a value.\n",
        "* Lists: Require you to manually pair keys and values, often using tuples or nested lists, which is less efficient and more error-prone.\n",
        "3. No Need to Maintain Order (Pre-Python 3.7)\n",
        "* Dictionaries: In Python 3.7 and later, dictionaries maintain insertion order, but even before that, they didn't guarantee order and focused on efficient access.\n",
        "* Lists: Suitable for ordered collections where order is important.\n",
        "If order is unnecessary, dictionaries are often more straightforward and faster for many tasks.\n",
        "4. Unique Keys\n",
        "* Dictionaries: Automatically ensure that keys are unique, overwriting values if a duplicate key is added.\n",
        "* Lists: Require additional logic to prevent duplicates when pairing keys with values.\n",
        "5. Readability and Simplicity\n",
        "* Dictionaries: Code involving dictionaries is often more readable and intuitive when dealing with mappings.\n",

        "##Q 19. why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
        "**Ans** - Dictionaries in Python are considered unordered because they do not maintain the order of their elements based on how they were inserted. This means that dictionaries store data as key-value pairs, but the order in which these pairs are stored or retrieved is not guaranteed. However, dictionaries maintain the insertion order of keys, but this order is not part of the dictionary's fundamental behavior.\n",

        "**Dictionaries are considered unordered for following reasons**\n",
        "1. Internal Implementation (Hash Table):\n",
        "  * Python dictionaries are implemented using a hash table, which is designed to allow fast lookups by keys.\n",
        "  * In a hash table, the keys are hashed into an index that determines where the corresponding value will be stored in memory. This hashing process is primarily focused on fast access to values, not maintaining the order of the keys.\n",
        "2. Key-Value Pair Structure:\n",
        "  * The dictionary's primary function is to map unique keys to values, and it optimizes for quick lookup and efficient storage rather than ordering."
